# Dynamic_Retail_Dashboard
This project is a dynamic retail dashboard built in Excel, using three tables: Order, People, and Return. The data is ingested from a folder, cleaned, and analyzed to extract meaningful business insights. The dashboard provides an interactive way to monitor sales, profit, and order trends across different regions, segments, and categories.
